problemStatements:
  part1: Authenticating your users can be tricky business
  part2: And it can be pretty bad if you get it wrong
  part3: >-
    Sure, you can pay for something off-the-shelf, but that can get expensive
    really quickly and you have to worry about integrating, vendor lock-in, and
    keeping your code up-to-date.
  part4:
    And whether you do decide to pay for an off-the-shelf solution or roll your
    own, you need to figure out how to code up your React components and data
    retrieval code to make sure the right user is shown the right thing at the
    right time. Tricky business indeed.
keyTakeaways:
  - title: Connect to a database
    description:
      Doing user auth without a persistence layer doesn't make a lot of sense,
      so in this workshop we're going to connect our app to a database and show
      how to ensure users have access to their own data (and nobody else's).
  - title: Hand roll our own auth
    description:
      Authentication is not nearly as complicated when you have the right tools
      and Remix is the right tool. In this workshop, we'll create our own cookie
      session management utilities that are simple and straightforward to extend
      and change as our authentication use cases change over time.
  - title: Protect pages
    description:
      There are some pages you don't want your end users to see if they aren't
      authenticated. It wouldn't do them any good anyway, so we'll redirect them
      to the login screen and send them back once they've successfully logged
      in.
  - title: Handle unauthorized requests
    description:
      Just because the user is authenticated doesn't mean they're authorized to
      do what they're trying to do. So we're going to stop them from doing
      things they're not allowed to do. And we're going to give them an
      excellent user experience while we're at it.

prerequisite: >-
  You should have experience with [these JavaScript
  features](/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react) and watch my [Beginner's Guide
  to React](https://kcd.im/beginner-react) or have the equivalent experience.
  Experience with Remix is a bonus, but not a requirement. This workshop will
  use TypeScript, but should be completable if you do not have experience with
  TypeScript.
