If I come across code like this:

```js
function getDisplayName({ firstName, lastName }) {
	const upperFirstCharacter = (string) =>
		string.slice(0, 1).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1)

	return `${upperFirstCharacter(firstName)} ${upperFirstCharacter(lastName)}`
}
```

Chances are, I'll refactor it to this:

```js
const upperFirstCharacter = (string) =>
	string.slice(0, 1).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1)

function getDisplayName({ firstName, lastName }) {
	return `${upperFirstCharacter(firstName)} ${upperFirstCharacter(lastName)}`
}
```

I tend to **put functions as close to the left side of the screen as reasonably
possible.** By that I mean, I like to reduce nesting of closures. A closure is
what is created when a function is created. It allows the function to access all
variables defined external to itself. And that's actually the reason I like to
avoid nesting closures: So I don't have to think about as many variables when
I'm working in a single function.

In our first code sample (where `upperFirstCharacter` is nested in
`getDisplayName`), it's possible for my function to access the `firstName` and
`lastName` variables. This means that while I'm working with it, I'm uncertain
whether I need to keep their values in mind. In addition to that, I have to
consider that it could access module-level definitions as well
(imports/variables/functions).

However, when I move it out (in the second example), I don't have to worry about
those variables because it's impossible to access them anyway (I'll probably not
even give it a moment's notice or thought). The only thing that function can
access is what's defined within it as well as what is defined at the
module-level (imports/variables/functions).

In this simple example, it's not a big deal because it's such a small function,
but in more complex scenarios the cognitive load can be a problem (and sometimes
you even have trouble with
[variable shadowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing) which can
increase cognitive load as well).

There are other arguments for doing this kind of thing as well:

1. Performance: not having to re-create the closure every time `getDisplayName`
   is called. This argument doesn't really hold water in typical scenarios.
   Unless you're calling that one billions of times then you're probably fine.
2. Testing: we could export `upperFirstCharacter` and test it in isolation. In
   this situation I wouldn't bother and I'd test `getDisplayName` instead. But
   sometimes if the code is complicated this can be useful.

In general, I'm interested in reducing the amount of trivial things my brain has
to think about so I can reserve my brain space for more important things and
that's my biggest argument for avoiding nesting of closures. That said, I'm not
religious about it and don't feel super strongly about this. It's just a
tendency I have.

Also, sometimes it's just unavoidable because you really need access to those
variables. For example:

```js
function addThings(additive, ...numbers) {
	const add = (n) => n + additive
	return numbers.map(add)
}

addThings(3, 1, 2, 3, 4)
// ↳ [4, 5, 6, 7]
```

In this case we can't move `add` out of `addThings` because it depends on the
`additive` parameter. We could extract `add` and accept an additional argument
and sometimes that can be useful for more complicated functions, but like I
said, I'm not religious about the "avoid nesting closures" rule so I think this
code is simpler the way that it is now and I'll probably leave it as-is.

I've had some conversations about this on twitter that have been interesting and
I think the most interesting insight so far has been from a thread where
[Lily Scott](https://x.com/suchipi) described
[a side-effect](https://x.com/suchipi/status/1206061075587682304) which
[Jed Fox](https://x.com/jed_fox1) summed up well in this tweet:

https://x.com/jed_fox1/status/1206061752737320960

So yes, this concept has nuance and there are trade-offs. I think I still prefer
extracting things because most of the time my files are only a few hundred lines
at most, so pulling something out does not increase the number of things that
can depend on it and I also feel like it's easier to think about "what can
depend on this thing" than "what can affect this thing." But again, it's too
nuanced to make a rule for.

Finding ways to offload thinking of trivial things is one skill that I'm always
trying to develop (automation plays a big role in that). I really don't want
anyone to make an ESLint rule about this idea (please don't do that), but it's
something to think about when you're trying to simplify some complicated code.
Try pulling things over to the left of the screen a bit. Good luck!
