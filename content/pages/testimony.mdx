I know that there is more to life than to be born and to die. Through my
experiences in life, I have come to know of God's plan of happiness.

Before coming to Earth, each of us was a spirit and we are all members of a
Heavenly Family. Our Heavenly Father and Mother love us dearly and prepared a
plan for us to grow and become as They are. This plan involved our coming to
Earth to receive a body as They have and returning to live with Them and our
loved ones again after our experience in life.

However, to grow to become like our Heavenly Parents, we must learn to exercise
faith. So it is required that we remember nothing of our pre-mortal existence.
As a result, all of us make mistakes and sin. This makes us unclean and prevents
us from returning to live with God because no unclean thing can live in the
presence of God.

To solve this problem, Heavenly Father chose our spirit brother, Jesus Christ,
to come to Earth Himself, live a perfect life, and perform the Atonement to pay
the price for our sins and give each of us the opportunity to repent and become
clean again. Because He walked such a long and lonely path completely alone, we
do not have to do so. He felt everything you and I have and will feel and can
help us through all of our struggles.

I know that Jesus Christ died for me, and for you. And because of this, He can
make us clean again. For us to accept His sacrifice, He asks that we follow His
example, strive to keep His commandments, and repent when we make mistakes. I
know that everything unfair about life can be made right by Jesus Christ.

To teach us about Jesus Christ and what He expects of us, God has called and
sent prophets throughout all time. The writings of ancient prophets can be found
in The Bible and The Book of Mormon.

We also have modern prophets in our day and they receive inspiration,
revelation, and authority from God to lead His children in His church which is
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I know that by listening to and
following the teachings of ancient and modern prophets, we can be certain we
know all we need to do to access the power of Jesus Christ.

I know this perfect plan is available to all, and I am forever grateful to our
Heavenly Parents and Savior Jesus Christ who made it possible for us to grow to
become as They are. I know that through this plan of happiness I can be with my
family forever. I don't know everything, but I know without a doubt that by
following Jesus Christ, we can find joy in this life, and eternal joy in the
life to come. And I will do everything within my power to ensure that future for
myself and those I love.
