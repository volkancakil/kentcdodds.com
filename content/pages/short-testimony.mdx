When I was a teenager, I read The Book of Mormon with a desire to know whether
the message it contains is true and divine. When I finished, I prayed and felt
an overwhelming confirmation that it is.

That experience has guided my life decisions ever since and I have continued to
have reaffirming experiences all my life.

I hope the message of Jesus Christ in this book helps you the way it helped me.

â€“ Kent C. Dodds
